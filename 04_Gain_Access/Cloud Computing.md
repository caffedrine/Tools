## I. Cloud computing concepts

#### Types of cloud computing
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) - virtual machines, HwAB OSes (computing power, data storage, etc)
- PaaS (Platform as a Service) - development tools, config management (e.g. Windows Azure)
- SaaS (Software as a Service) - sofrware to subscribers (e.g. Google Docs, Calendar, etc)
- IDaaS (Identity as a Service) - cloud based authentication, multifactor authentication (OneLogin, Okta)
- SECaaS (Security as a Service) - peenetration testing, authentication, intrusiuon detection, anti-malware, security incident, etc in the cloud (McAfee Managed Security)
- CaaS (Container as a Service) - virtualization  of container enginees (Docker, AWS EC2, Kubernets)
- FaaS (Function as a Service) - functions to run microservices

#### Cloud deployment models
- Public cloud - services open for public use
- Private cloud - cloud infrastructure operated by single organization only
- Community cloud - shared infrastructure between organizations from a specific community (security, compliance, etc)
- Hybrid cloud - combination of multiple clouds (e.g. public + private cloud)
- Multi cloud - environment that uses cloud from multiple providers


#### Cloud computing actors
- Cloud consumer - person/org that uses cloud
- Cloud provider - person/org providing cloud resources
- Cloud carrier - intermediary for providing connectivity, transport services, etc.
- Cloud auditor - entity for making independent assesments of cloud service controls (security audit, privacy audit, performance audit)
- Cloud broker - entity that manages cloud services in terrms of use, performance, delivery. Maintains the relationship between cloud provider and end user.


#### Cloud storage architecture
- Front-end - public APIs for data and management
- Midleware - object storage, virtual servers, etc
- Back-end - phisical storage servers

## II. containers technology

#### Containers architecture
- Tier-1 - Developer machines for image creation and testing
- Tier-2 - Testing and accreditation systems
- Tier-3 - Registries
- Tier-4 - Orchestrators 
- Tier-5 - Hosts
